##Lecture
- AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning

### AI
- Intelligence exhibited by machines
- Broadly defined to include any simulation of human Intelligence
- Expanding and branching areas of research, development and investment
- Includes robotics, rule-based reasoning, natural language processing (NLP), knowledge representation techniques (knowledge graphs), ...

### Machine Learning
- Subfield of AI, teaches computers the ability to do tasks with data, without explicit programming
- Uses numerical and statistical approaches, including artificial neural network techniques to encode Learning
- Models are built using "training" computation runs, can also train through usage

### Deep Learning
- Subfield of ML that uses specialized computational techniques, typically multi-layer (2+) artificial neural networks
- Layering allows cascaded learning and abstraction levels (e.g. line recognition --> shape --> object --> scene)
- Computationally intensive enabled by clouds, GPUs, and increasingly more specialized HW such as FPGA and new custom hardware

"70 - 80% of human intelligence"

### Machine learning cycle
- Prepare Data
- Train Model
- Apply Model
- Monitor
- Repeat

## Learning Methods:
- Supervised Learning
 - Teach desired behavior with labele data
 - Make sense of new data based on prior data
- Unsupervised Learning
 - Make inferences without labeled data
 - Discover unknown or hidden patterns
- Reinforcement Learning
 - Act in an environment to maximize reward
 - Build autonomous agents that learn
 - e.g. games

### Machine Learning techniques
- Classification
 - supervised -- predictive
- Regression
 - Supervised - predictive
- Deep Learning -- Neural Networks
- Clustering
 - Unsupervised - descriptive
- Anomaly Detecting
 - unsupervised -- descriptive
- Recommender Systems

### Understanding Demand Pattern recognition
- Statistical forecasting eliminates the "noise" to determine best "explainable" forecast
- Demand Sensing predicts the actual "noise" as you get closer to the demand period
- Demand sensing complements Demand Planning by adjusting the demand planning forcase based on recent and current patterns in demand signals using data mining

- Unsupervised Machine Learning
 - Machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses

### Clustering - what and why?
- Partitioning or grouping of similar data points
- Humans have a natural tendency of grouping objects.
- With un-supervised learning machines can partition like humans e.g. living and non-living; animals and plants, etc
- Examples of clustering in real-world
 - Cluster products based on sales history
 - Cluster Customers based on similar buying patterns
 - Clusters Mutual funds based on fund behavior
 - Recommendation engines, market segmentation, social network analysis, medical imaging and anomaly detection
